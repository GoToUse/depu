## Why depu is needed

For Go devs, we often need to check if any updates on my dependencies. Some advantages on keeping up-to-date:
- get more features
- known bugs or security issues get fixed
- not breaking for deprecated usages on must upgrade

And `go list` lists all the dependent packages for both direct and indirect usages, and `Indirect` fields always telling true. For details, check this issue:

## Design ideas

- use `go list -u -m -json all` to get all the available updates for both direct and indirect usages.
- parse local `go.mod` to get directly required packages.
- only display the availabe updates for directly required packages.

## Installation

```shell
$ go install github.com/kevwan/depu@latest
```

## How to use

In the directory of `go.mod`, run the following command:

```shell
$ depu
```
